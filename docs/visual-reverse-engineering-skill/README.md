# Visual Reverse Engineering Skill Docs

This folder documents the StorefrontBuilder workflow for turning reference ecommerce storefront evidence into reviewable, generated Blazor storefront projects.

## Read First

1. [StorefrontBuilder Architecture](../architecture/11-storefront-builder.md) - ownership, boundaries, artifact rules, and validation gates.
2. [Reference](reference.md) - commands, modes, generated artifacts, and gate expectations.
3. [How To Generate And Validate](how-to-generate-and-validate.md) - operator workflow for an existing or new generated storefront.
4. [Tutorial: BuilderDemo](tutorial-builder-demo.md) - concrete walkthrough using the committed `BuilderDemo` storefront.
5. [Explanation: Boundaries And Regeneration](explanation-boundaries-and-regeneration.md) - why generated storefronts stay isolated from Storefront V2 and backend projects.

## Historical Plans

The phase plans are retained as implementation history and checklist evidence:

- [01-StorefrontBuilder-Foundation.todo.md](01-StorefrontBuilder-Foundation.todo.md)
- [02-StorefrontBuilder-Visual-Generation.todo.md](02-StorefrontBuilder-Visual-Generation.todo.md)
- [03-StorefrontBuilder-QA-Regeneration.todo.md](03-StorefrontBuilder-QA-Regeneration.todo.md)
- [StorefrontBuilder Architecture Note](StorefrontBuilder-architecture-note.md)

The architecture docs are the current source of truth when a historical plan conflicts with current code.
