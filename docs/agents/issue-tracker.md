# Issue Tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

Repository: `TjnhPro/BlazorShop`

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, filtering comments by `jq` and also fetching labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

Infer the repo from `git remote -v`; `gh` does this automatically when run inside a clone.

## Pull Requests As A Triage Surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.**

This repo is currently maintained as a solo-dev workflow. Skills should triage GitHub Issues, not external pull requests. If this changes later, update this file to `yes` and document how external PRs should be handled.

## When A Skill Says "Publish To The Issue Tracker"

Create a GitHub issue.

## When A Skill Says "Fetch The Relevant Ticket"

Run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

## Wayfinding Operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The map is a single issue with child issues as tickets.

- **Map**: a single issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body. Create it with `gh issue create --label wayfinder:map`.
- **Child ticket**: an issue linked to the map as a GitHub sub-issue. Where sub-issues are not enabled, add the child to a task list in the map body and put `Part of #<map>` at the top of the child body. Labels: `wayfinder:<type>` (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`).
- **Blocking**: use GitHub native issue dependencies when available. Where dependencies are not available, fall back to a `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` line at the top of the child body.
- **Frontier query**: list the map's open children, drop blocked or assigned issues, and pick the first in map order.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me`.
- **Resolve**: `gh issue comment <n> --body "<answer>"`, then `gh issue close <n>`, then append a context pointer to the map's Decisions-so-far.
